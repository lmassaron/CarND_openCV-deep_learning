Udacity's Self-Driving Car Nanodegree project files, notes and execises

This repository contains my project files, lecture notes and exercises for Udacity's Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree program I started attending to on 27th October 2016.

## Program Outline:
### Term 1: Deep Learning and Computer Vision
- Project 1: Finding Lane Lines (Intro to Computer Vision)
- Project 2: Traffic Sign Classifier (Deep Learning)
	- `deep-learning`: Notes on Deep Learning, Tensorflow and Keras

### Term 2: Sensor Fusion, Localisation and Control
- Sensor Fusion: Integrating different types of sensors.
- Localisation: 'Where relative to the world is a car?' Alignment of car, sensors to the map. 
- Control: Computer program that steers cars, wheels so as to meet an objective.

### Term 3: Path Planning, Controlling a Self-Driving Car
- Path Planning: Finding a sequence of steps in a maze (navigating cities, parking lots)
- Put your code in a self-driving car
